# Brick-Breaker-Game
A simple game made in C++ language and can be played easily using a C++ compiler.
I recommend you to use visual studio compiler.
The graphics library included with C++ code file must be in the same folder.
Enjoy the game and play it.
The graphics library must be included in the header of C++ code file.
